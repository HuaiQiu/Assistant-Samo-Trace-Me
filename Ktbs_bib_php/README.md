KTBS BIB PHP
========

The KTBS_BIB_PHP is a PHP package used to communicate with [KTBS](https://kernel-for-trace-based-systems.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) ( Kernel of Trace Based Systems ) and use almost of its functionality.


It contains essentially 5 classes which are : KtbsRoot, Base, Trace, TraceModel, ComputedTrace.


We will present all these classes in this documents and all of the classes methods.

KtbsRoot
====================== 
This class is used mainly to identify the KTBS using his URI.


Methods :
##### __construct($root_uri):
The constructor for a KtbsRoot Object.
The variable $root_uri is a string variable which contains the URI of the KTBS

##### Bool exist() :

This method verify if the Ktbs exist of not.It returns True if it exist and False if not.

##### Array getListOfBases() :

This method return an Array which contains all existing base in the KTBS.

Base
====================== 
This class is used mainly used to create a base in the Ktbs.


Methods :
##### __construct($base_uri)
##### __construct($root_uri,$name)
The constructor of this class can be called in two manner : with the Base uri as argument
($base_uri) , or with Root uri and the Base name as argument ( $root_uri, $name).
The variables $root_uri, $base_uri and $name are strings variables which contains the URI of
the KTBS , URI of the Base and the Base's name

##### Bool exist()
This method verify if the Base exist of not. It returns True if it exist and False if not.

##### Bool dump()
this method create the base in the KTBS if it doesn't exist before.
It return True if the creation was successful and return False if not.
Array getListOfTraces()
this method return an Array which contains all existing Traces in the Base.
Array getListOfModels()
this method return an Array which contains all existing Trace Models in the Base.
String getUri()
this method return a string which contains the URI of the base.
BringTrace( Trace $trace, $model_uri)
This method allow to bring one trace and change it's model
use :
$Base->bringTrace(Trace_Object,uri_of_new_model);
if you don't want to change the model
$Base->bringTrace(Trace_Object,Trace_Object->getModel);
bringListOfTraces(Array $Traces, $modelname)
This method allow to bring a list of traces in this base and a create a global model for all traces
if the model exists already, it will be updated.
use :
$Base->bringListOfTraces(array_of_Trace_Object,model_Name);

Trace
====================== 

TraceModel
====================== 

ComputedTrace
======================
